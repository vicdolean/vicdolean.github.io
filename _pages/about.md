Victorita Dolean is Full Professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science), [Centre for Analysis Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA)](https://casa.win.tue.nl/home/) at [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU Eindhoven)](https://www.tue.nl/en/).

Her main research areas are **numerical methods for partial differential equations** and scientific computing, with a strong focus on numerical linear algebra, in particular preconditioning techniques based on **domain decomposition methods**. A central theme of her work is **computational wave propagation**, with special emphasis on **high-frequency wave problems**, where scalability and robustness are major challenges.
She is interested in applications to **medical imaging** and **geophysical (seismic) imaging**, as well as in the development of methods capable of handling complex geometries, highly heterogeneous coefficient functions, and the coupling of multiple physical processes. Her research is closely connected to **high-performance computing (HPC)** and the design of algorithms that remain effective at large scale.
More recently, Victorita has also been focusing on the combination of scientific computing and machine learning, a rapidly emerging field known as **scientific machine learning (SciML)**. Overall, her work spans the development of novel numerical methods, their theoretical foundations, and their efficient implementation and validation on real-world problems.
